Build a minimal, modern iOS app using SwiftUI for current iOS standards.
Target device: iPhone 15, iOS 26.1.
The app will be tested locally in Xcode and the iOS Simulator.

Purpose

The app is a photo review utility with exactly one function:
show random photos from the user’s photo library and allow keeping or deleting them.

Permissions

Request Photo Library access using the modern iOS Photos permission flow.

Support both Full Access and Limited Access.

Load all photos the app is allowed to access (no extra filtering).

Core Behavior

After permission is granted:

Load all accessible images

Randomly select one photo at a time

Display the photo fullscreen, clean and distraction-free.

User Interaction

Swipe right → Keep

The photo must never be shown again in the session.

Swipe left → Delete

Delete the photo using the Photos API so it ends up in “Recently Deleted”

After each action, immediately show the next random photo.

Buttons

At the bottom of the screen, add two simple buttons:

“Keep”

“Delete”

Buttons must trigger the same logic as swipe gestures.

UI / UX

No menus

No navigation

No settings

No onboarding

No animations beyond basic system gestures

Very clean, modern, minimal design

Dark-mode friendly

Technical Notes

Use SwiftUI

Use Photos / PhotosUI framework

Handle permission states safely

Ensure the app does not crash if the library is empty or access is denied

The app only needs to work locally (no App Store requirements)

Output

Provide complete SwiftUI code

Code must compile and run

Focus on correctness and simplicity over extra features
